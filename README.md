# HelloWorld_with_input
 Made in Python


Funny thing about this, is that this was ACTUALLY made in Python, like I first intended.

I didn't realise until i tried to run the code via Python 3.8 that i wrote it all in C#.

I regret that a full discord of people now know i've done this.


I hope one day to recover from this meme of a mistake....
